# Okada-Dislocation-Model-of-GPS-Velocities
The matlab codes help to model the observed velocities from GPS stations of both strike-slip and thrust faults.

Codes: Dip_slip_Okada_Error and Strike_slip_Okada_Error contain three sections


1. First Section: Visualizes horizontal geodetic motion at surface

2. Second Section: Generates the Okada dislocation model curve (or the slip rate deficit curve)

3. Third Section: Misfit analysis between the observed and modelled GPS velocities for dip-slip or strike-slip faults (Variable: Slip rate & Locking Depth ; Constant: Dip & Vertical Offset uY)

Writes two files containing the RMSE values and Okada Locking curve
