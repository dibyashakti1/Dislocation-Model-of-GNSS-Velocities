# Okada-Dislocation-Model-of-GPS-Velocities
The matlab codes help to model the observed velocities from GPS stations of both strike-slip and thrust faults.

Codes: Dip_slip_Okada_Error and Strike_slip_Okada_Error contain three sections



First Section: Visualizes horizontal geodetic motion at surface
